/**
 * Renders Aechronis's own draw features (nation fills, borders, labels) directly,
 * completely independent of XaeroPlus's shared DrawFeatureRegistry — which is
 * gated behind HudMod.INSTANCE.isFairPlay() (xaeroplus.feature.render.DrawManager,
 * methods drawMinimapFeatures / drawWorldMapFeatures).
 *
 * SCOPE OF THE FAIRPLAY WORKAROUND IN THIS FILE:
 *   1. HEAD inject: renders OUR overlay (AechronisRenderer.ourFeatures) unconditionally
 *      (a no-op when the list is empty — see gating note below).
 *   2. @Redirect on isFairPlay() within drawMinimapFeatures / drawWorldMapFeatures:
 *      forces the check to return false so XaeroPlus's OWN draw features registered
 *      via Globals.drawManager.registry() (the user drawing tool, view-distance
 *      squares, etc.) also render on this server. This is a broader scope than the
 *      original overlay-only workaround, explicitly approved by the server admin
 *      FOR CRUSALIS SPECIFICALLY — see gating note below.
 *
 * SERVER GATING: the @Redirect only forces isFairPlay() false while
 * AechronisRenderer.ourFeatures is non-empty, which is exactly the condition
 * AechronisMapMod's JOIN handler maintains: non-empty only while connected to
 * Crusalis (server address contains "crusalis.net") and the renderer is enabled;
 * cleared on disconnect, server switch, or any other early-return path in that
 * handler. Elsewhere (any other server, or before the renderer has enabled), the
 * redirect delegates to the REAL isFairPlay() value — the bypass never applies off
 * Crusalis. This mod may later ship separate per-server builds/approvals; each
 * such build should gate this the same way, scoped to whatever server it targets.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT TOUCH (per admin condition: "cave mode and entity radar must
 * stay disabled, everything else is ok"):
 *   - Core Xaero's entity radar fairplay enforcement (separate mechanism, lives in
 *     core Xaero classes like MixinGuiEntityRadarSettings — completely untouched).
 *   - Core Xaero's cave mode fairplay enforcement (separate mechanism, untouched).
 *   - The HudMod.isFairPlay() flag itself is NOT modified globally — the redirect
 *     only takes effect when isFairPlay() is called from within these two specific
 *     methods, AND only while on Crusalis per the gating above. Any other code that
 *     checks isFairPlay() still sees the real value.
 *
 * VERIFICATION TO RUN AFTER DEPLOY: confirm cave mode and entity radar are STILL
 * blocked on Crusalis (try to enable them in XaeroPlus settings — they should still
 * be gated), AND confirm fairplay is untouched on a non-Crusalis server (join one,
 * confirm XaeroPlus's own draw features stay fairplay-gated there). If either check
 * fails, revert this file immediately.
 *
 * VERSION COMPATIBILITY: every injector below is `require = 0` (soft-fail) rather
 * than the mixins.json default of 1 (hard-fail). This mixin targets DrawManager's
 * internal method names/signatures and a specific isFairPlay() call site — none of
 * that is part of XaeroPlus's stable public addon API (unlike AechronisRenderer's
 * xaeroplus.feature.render.* usage, which is), so a future/older XaeroPlus release
 * could change it without warning. With require=0, a mismatch just fails this one
 * mixin quietly (Mixin logs a WARN) and the overlay/fairplay-bypass silently no-ops
 * instead of crashing the client outright — degrading gracefully across whatever
 * XaeroPlus version the user actually has installed, rather than an all-or-nothing
 * dependency pin.
